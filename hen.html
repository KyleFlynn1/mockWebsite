                    <p>Hens really enjoy the springtime, you can tour the farm and see our hens.</p>
                    <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeding
                        and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring,
                        but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and 
                        customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the 
                        Southern Hemispehere and vice versa. At the spring (or venal) equinox days
                        and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing
                        and nighttime lenght decreasing as teh season progresses, Sprint and "springtime"
                        refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth of animals, rejuvenatino, renewal,
                        ressurection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better
                        described in terms of other season, e.g. dry or wet, nonsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures
                        may have local names for seasons which have little equivalance to the terms originating
                        in Europe.<a href="https://cooleyfarm.ie/"> Visit Website For More Details </a>
