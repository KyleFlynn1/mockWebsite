                    <p>Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mountain of Europe and Asia
                        , with Iran being geographic envelope of the deomestication center[1] 
                        One of the earliest animals to be deomesticated for agricultural purposes, Sheep
                        are raised for fleeces, meat(lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A 
                        sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber and is usually harvested by
                        shearing. In Commonswealth countries, ovine meat is called lamb when from younger
                        animals and mutton when from older ones; In the United States, meat from both older
                        and younger animals is usually called lamb. Sheep continue to be important for wool and
                        meat today and are also occasinally raised for pelts, as dairy animals or as model organisms

                    <p>Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled[30] Sheep
                        have horiozontal slit-shaped
                        pupils, with excellent peripheral vision; with visual fields of about 270 to 320, sheep
                        can see behind themselves without turning their heads.[23][31] Many breeds have only short hair 
                        on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle;
                        the wide angles of perihperal vision apply to these breeds. A few breeds tend to have considerable wool on the face
                        for some individuals of these breeds, perihperal vision may be greatly reduced by "wool blindeness",
                        unless recently shorn about the face.[32] Sheep have poor depth perception; shadows and dips in 
                        the ground may cause sheep to baulk. In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark
                        and into well-lit areas<a href="https://cooleyfarm.ie/"> Visit Website For More Details </a>
